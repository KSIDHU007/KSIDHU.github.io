	   <section>It gives you freedom to disconnect from the confines of the human 
	   body and get to explore the speeds and sensations that you can only experience in a car.
	   When a car gives you an unfiltered connection to that experience and really talks to you, 
	   it bends perfectly to your will so that you become almost unaware that you’re driving a car.

	  <section>Cars have multiple seats for a good reason. It’s so that other people can join you on your journey!
	  Cars are one of the greatest environments for bonding with family and friends. 
	  There’s not much better than a good road trip with a few of your closest friends, or maybe just your significant other. 
	  Snacks in the glovebox, suitcase in the boot, tunes on the stereo.
